## Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

### Tuples

Tuples are a built-in data type in Python. They consist of an immutable, indexed sequence of values.
Immutable means that once a tuple is created, you cannot change it.
Indexed means that the order of the values matters and each has a fixed position.
Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values within parentheses.
